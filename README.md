* basic workflow
* you have a directory of files
* once you initialize Git we call it a repository or repo
* edit files 
* add files (to the stage)
* commit them
	

 [GitHub](http://www.github.com) is a place to store snapshots of your code 
 and network with others who might want to improve your code and help you debug.
